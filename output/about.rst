I'm the CLIR Digital Humanities Postdoctoral Fellow at the Jackman Humanities Institute, University of Toronto (2019-20). I received my PhD in English from Yale University, where I worked on early modern theatre and culture.

My current book-length project, *Artificial Persons: Fictions of Representation in Early Modern Drama*, asks: how did the stage contribute to the idea that we can authorize people not just to speak and act on our behalf, but to stand in *for* us and take on aspects of our personhood? Examining plays alongside imaginative prose, legal texts, corporate documents, and theological treatises, I argue that Renaissance drama can reinvigorate our sense of what it means (and how it feels) to be represented and to represent others in turn.

Other research interests include gender and sexuality studies, law and literature, religious toleration, and the history of Shakespearean performance and editing. I've `written on these topics <http://andrewsbrown.net/research/>`__ for the journals *Studies in Philology*, *Eighteenth-Century Studies, Milton Studies*, and *Early Theatre*; the edited collection *Shakespeare and Consciousness*; and the *Marginalia Review of Books*. A full list of publications and awards can be found `in my CV <http://andrewsbrown.net/cv/>`__.

My approach both to working with students and to my own research sits at the intersection of two fields: the history of the book and the digital humanities. See the pages on my `DH <http://andrewsbrown.net/digital-humanities/>`__ and `book history <http://andrewsbrown.net/book-history/>`__ scholarship for more details, or visit my `Teaching <http://andrewsbrown.net/teaching/>`__ page for information on my courses.
