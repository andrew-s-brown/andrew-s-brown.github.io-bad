      A first-year writing seminar of my own design. By analyzing and discussing argumentative prose from a range of disciplines, students learn the fundamentals of college writing. Themes and topics include animal communication and consciousness; animal rights; constructions of race, gender, sexuality, and Indigenous identity; and climate change and food insecurity. Authors include Charles Darwin, Rachel Carson, Donna Haraway, Charlotte Coté, and Claire Jean Kim.

  **\ ENGL 115 (Introductory Literature Seminar)
| Homesick: Nostalgia in Literature
| Fall 2018

A first-year literature seminar of my own design. By analyzing texts belonging to a wide range of genres, modes, and historical periods, students learn to craft well-argued critical essays. Our discussions explore the comforts and the personal and political hazards of nostalgia in texts like *The Odyssey*, William Shakespeare’s *Pericles*, Nella Larsen’s *Quicksand*, and Viet Thanh Nguyen’s *The Refugees*.

A literature survey lecture course for which I led one seminar discussion section. Major authors included Bram Stoker, Angela Carter, Mary Shelley, and Horace Walpole. With the support of a competitive Digital Humanities Teaching Fellowship, I collaborated with staff at Yale’s Digital Humanities Laboratory to design a set of assignments that combined literary criticism with methods like distant reading, network visualization, and GIS mapping.
